# About Me

Hi, I'm Yi Zhe Wang! (but I also go by "Tim")

I'm a third-year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in statistical sciences and minoring in mathematics and history and philosophy of sciences. Scientific theories and practices are powerful tools, but I believe that no single account can tell the whole story. This is why understanding the history and philosophy behind science is also important, as it teaches us not only it's power, but also it's limits. 

## Portfolio: Statistics and Data Science

> ### [Project 1: Toronto Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/Not20913/PCV/blob/main/sta303_data-exploration_task_completed.pdf)

This project is about visualizing the reported cases of Covid-19 in Toronto in three different circumstances through coding. In the three sections of codes, I recreated a histogram of reported cases by dates, a histogram of cases by outbreak type and week, and three maps that shows low-income information and Covid-19 case information by neighborhood separately and together in one map. The project also includes my codes for the data wrangling section which prepared data frames that were suitable for data visualization.

## Portfolio: History and Philosophy of Science

In the courses I took on history and philosophy of science, I worked on some interesting historical and philosophical topics. Here are some of the essays I wrote during those courses.

> [Essay: On Automata, Autonomy, and How They Relate to Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/Tim%20Wang%20-%20On%20Automata%2C%20Autonomy%2C%20and%20How%20They%20Relate%20to%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) Theme: History and Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence 
> [Essay: Can the Concept of Intelligence be Well-defined?](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/Tim%20Wang%20-%20Can%20the%20Concept%20of%20Intelligence%20be%20Well-Defined.pdf) Theme: History and Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence
